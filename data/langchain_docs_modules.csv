0,0,"# Getting Started  This notebook walks through how LangChain thinks about memory.   Memory involves keeping a concept of state around throughout a user's interactions with an language model. A user's interactions with a language model are captured in the concept of ChatMessages, so this boils down to ingesting, capturing, transforming and extracting knowledge from a sequence of chat messages. There are many different ways to do this, each of which exists as its own memory type.  In general, for each type of memory there are two ways to understanding using memory. These are the standalone functions which extract information from a sequence of messages, and then there is the way you can use this type of memory in a chain.   Memory can return multiple pieces of information (for example, the most recent N messages and a summary of all previous messages). The returned information can either be a string or a list of messages.  In this notebook, we will walk through the simplest form of memory: ""buffer"" memory, which just involves keeping a buffer of all prior messages. We will show how to use the modular utility functions here, then show how it can be used in a chain (both returning a string as well as a list of messages).  ## ChatMessageHistory One of the core utility classes underpinning most (if not all) memory modules is the `ChatMessageHistory` class. This is a super lightweight wrapper which exposes convenience methods for saving Human messages, AI messages, and then fetching them all.   You may want to use this class directly if you are managing memory outside of a chain. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.memory import ChatMessageHistory

history = ChatMessageHistory()

history.add_user_message(""hi!"")

history.add_ai_message(""whats up?"")

history.messages

1,1,"## ConversationBufferMemory  We now show how to use this simple concept in a chain. We first showcase `ConversationBufferMemory` which is just a wrapper around ChatMessageHistory that extracts the messages in a variable.  We can first extract it as a string. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"")
memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"")

memory.load_memory_variables({})

We can also get the history as a list of messages 
Here is some code:
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)
memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"")
memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"")

",124,langchain/docs/modules/memory/getting_started.ipynb
3,3,"## Saving Message History  You may often have to save messages, and then load them to use again. This can be done easily by first converting the messages to normal python dictionaries, saving those (as json or something) and then loading those. Here is an example of doing that. 
Here is some code:
import json

from langchain.memory import ChatMessageHistory
from langchain.schema import messages_from_dict, messages_to_dict

history = ChatMessageHistory()

history.add_user_message(""hi!"")

history.add_ai_message(""whats up?"")

Here is some code:
from langchain import OpenAI, ConversationChain
from langchain.schema import BaseMemory
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Dict, Any

In this example, we will write a custom memory class that uses spacy to extract entities and save information about them in a simple hash table. Then, during the conversation, we will look at the input text, extract any entities, and put any information about them into the context.  * Please note that this implementation is pretty simple and brittle and probably not useful in a production setting. Its purpose is to showcase that you can add custom memory implementations.  For this, we will need spacy.

# !python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg

import spacy

    def save_context(self, inputs: Dict[str, Any], outputs: Dict[str, str]) -> None:

Relevant entity information:

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=[""entities"", ""input""], template=template
)

And now we put it all together! 
Here is some code:
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=SpacyEntityMemory())

In the first example, with no prior knowledge about Harrison, the ""Relevant entity information"" section is empty. 
Here is some code:
conversation.predict(input=""Harrison likes machine learning"")

Now in the second example, we can see that it pulls in information about Harrison. 
Here is some code:
conversation.predict(input=""What do you think Harrison's favorite subject in college was?"")

Again, please note that this implementation is pretty simple and brittle and probably not useful in a production setting. Its purpose is to showcase that you can add custom memory implementations.

We are going to create a `RedisChatMessageHistory` to connect to an external database to store the messages in. 2. We are going to create an `LLMChain` using that chat history as memory. 3. We are going to use that `LLMChain` to create a custom Agent.  For the purposes of this exercise, we are going to create a simple custom Agent that has access to a search tool and utilizes the `ConversationBufferMemory` class.

37,37,"# Callbacks 
LangChain provides a callbacks system that allows you to hook into the various stages of your LLM application. This is useful for logging, [monitoring](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/tracing.html), [streaming](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/llms/examples/streaming_llm.html), and other tasks.  You can subscribe to these events by using the `callbacks` argument available throughout the API. This argument is list of handler objects, which are expected to implement one or more of the methods described below in more detail. There are two main callbacks mechanisms:  * *Constructor callbacks* will be used for all calls made on that object, and will be scoped to that object only, i.e. if you pass a handler to the `LLMChain` constructor, it will not be used by the model attached to that chain.  * *Request callbacks* will be used for that specific request only, and all sub-requests that it contains (eg. a call to an `LLMChain` triggers a call to a Model, which uses the same handler passed through). These are explicitly passed through.   **Advanced:** When you create a custom chain you can easily set it up to use the same callback system as all the built-in chains.  `_call`, `_generate`, `_run`, and equivalent async methods on Chains / LLMs / Chat Models / Agents / Tools now receive a 2nd argument called `run_manager` which is bound to that run, and contains the logging methods that can be used by that object (i.e. `on_llm_new_token`). This is useful when constructing a custom chain. See this guide for more information on how to [create custom chains and use callbacks inside them.](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/generic/custom_chain.html) 
`CallbackHandlers` are objects that implement the `CallbackHandler` interface, which has a method for each event that can be subscribed to. The `CallbackManager` will call the appropriate method on each handler when the event is triggered.

38,38,"## How to use callbacks  The `callbacks` argument is available on most objects throughout the API (Chains, Models, Tools, Agents, etc.) in two different places:  - **Constructor callbacks**: defined in the constructor, eg. `LLMChain(callbacks=[handler])`, which will be used for all calls made on that object, and will be scoped to that object only, eg. if you pass a handler to the `LLMChain` constructor, it will not be used by the Model attached to that chain. - **Request callbacks**: defined in the `call()`/`run()`/`apply()` methods used for issuing a request, eg. `chain.call(inputs, callbacks=[handler])`, which will be used for that specific request only, and all sub-requests that it contains (eg. a call to an LLMChain triggers a call to a Model, which uses the same handler passed in the `call()` method).  The `verbose` argument is available on most objects throughout the API (Chains, Models, Tools, Agents, etc.) as a constructor argument, eg. `LLMChain(verbose=True)`, and it is equivalent to passing a `ConsoleCallbackHandler` to the `callbacks` argument of that object and all child objects. This is useful for debugging, as it will log all events to the console.  ### When do you want to use each of these?  - Constructor callbacks are most useful for use cases such as logging, monitoring, etc., which are _not specific to a single request_, but rather to the entire chain. For example, if you want to log all the requests made to an LLMChain, you would pass a handler to the constructor. - Request callbacks are most useful for use cases such as streaming, where you want to stream the output of a single request to a specific websocket connection, or other similar use cases. For example, if you want to stream the output of a single request to a websocket, you would pass a handler to the `call()` method

The most basic handler is the `StdOutCallbackHandler`, which simply logs all events to `stdout`. In the future we will add more default handlers to the library.   **Note** when the `verbose` flag on the object is set to true, the `StdOutCallbackHandler` will be invoked even without being explicitly passed in.

42,42,"## Using multiple handlers, passing in handlers  In the previous examples, we passed in callback handlers upon creation of an object by using `callbacks=`. In this case, the callbacks will be scoped to that particular object.   However, in many cases, it is advantageous to pass in handlers instead when running the object. When we pass through `CallbackHandlers` using the `callbacks` keyword arg when executing an run, those callbacks will be issued by all nested objects involved in the execution. For example, when a handler is passed through to an `Agent`, it will be used for all callbacks related to the agent and all the objects involved in the agent's execution, in this case, the `Tools`, `LLMChain`, and `LLM`.  This prevents us from having to manually attach the handlers to each individual nested object.

50,50,"# Getting Started  Agents use an LLM to determine which actions to take and in what order. An action can either be using a tool and observing its output, or returning to the user.  When used correctly agents can be extremely powerful. The purpose of this notebook is to show you how to easily use agents through the simplest, highest level API. 
In order to load agents, you should understand the following concepts:  - Tool: A function that performs a specific duty. This can be things like: Google Search, Database lookup, Python REPL, other chains. The interface for a tool is currently a function that is expected to have a string as an input, with a string as an output. - LLM: The language model powering the agent. - Agent: The agent to use. This should be a string that references a support agent class. Because this notebook focuses on the simplest, highest level API, this only covers using the standard supported agents. If you want to implement a custom agent, see the documentation for custom agents (coming soon).  **Agents**: For a list of supported agents and their specifications, see [here](agents.md).  **Tools**: For a list of predefined tools and their specifications, see [here](tools.md). 
Here is some code:
from langchain.agents import load_tools
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentType
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

First, let's load the language model we're going to use to control the agent. 
Here is some code:
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

Next, let's load some tools to use. Note that the `llm-math` tool uses an LLM, so we need to pass that in. 
Here is some code:
tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm)

Finally, let's initialize an agent with the tools, the language model, and the type of agent we want to use. 
Here is some code:
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)

Now let's test it out!

51,51,"# Defining Custom Tools  When constructing your own agent, you will need to provide it with a list of Tools that it can use. Besides the actual function that is called, the Tool consists of several components:  - name (str), is required and must be unique within a set of tools provided to an agent - description (str), is optional but recommended, as it is used by an agent to determine tool use - return_direct (bool), defaults to False - args_schema (Pydantic BaseModel), is optional but recommended, can be used to provide more information (e.g., few-shot examples) or validation for expected parameters.   There are two main ways to define a tool, we will cover both in the example below.

65,65,"## Multi-Input Tools with a string format  An alternative to the structured tool would be to use the regular `Tool` class and accept a single string. The tool would then have to handle the parsing logic to extract the relavent values from the text, which tightly couples the tool representation to the agent prompt. This is still useful if the underlying language model can't reliabl generate structured schema.   Let's take the multiplication function as an example. In order to use this, we will tell the agent to generate the ""Action Input"" as a comma-separated list of length two. We will then write a thin wrapper that takes a string, splits it into two around a comma, and passes both parsed sides as integers to the multiplication function.

66,66,"## AWS Lambda API 
This notebook goes over how to use the AWS Lambda Tool component.  AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), designed to allow developers to build and run applications and services without the need for provisioning or managing servers. This serverless architecture enables you to focus on writing and deploying code, while AWS automatically takes care of scaling, patching, and managing the infrastructure required to run your applications.  By including a `awslambda` in the list of tools provided to an Agent, you can grant your Agent the ability to invoke code running in your AWS Cloud for whatever purposes you need.  When an Agent uses the awslambda tool, it will provide an argument of type string which will in turn be passed into the Lambda function via the event parameter.  First, you need to install `boto3` python package. 
Here is some code:
!pip install boto3 > /dev/null

In order for an agent to use the tool, you must provide it with the name and description that match the functionality of you lambda function's logic.   You must also provide the name of your function.  
Note that because this tool is effectively just a wrapper around the boto3 library, you will need to run `aws configure` in order to make use of the tool. For more detail, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html) 
Here is some code:

68,68," # GraphQL tool This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to use the BaseGraphQLTool component with an Agent.  GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries against your data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.  By including a BaseGraphQLTool in the list of tools provided to an Agent, you can grant your Agent the ability to query data from GraphQL APIs for any purposes you need.  In this example, we'll be using the public Star Wars GraphQL API available at the following endpoint: https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/index.  First, you need to install httpx and gql Python packages. 
Here is some code:
pip install httpx gql > /dev/null

Now, let's create a BaseGraphQLTool instance with the specified Star Wars API endpoint and initialize an Agent with the tool. 
Here is some code:
from langchain import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent, AgentType
from langchain.utilities import GraphQLAPIWrapper

agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)

Now, we can use the Agent to run queries against the Star Wars GraphQL API. Let's ask the Agent to list all the Star Wars films and their release dates. 
Here is some code:
graphql_fields = """"""allFilms {
    films {
      title

[Apify](https://apify.com) is a cloud platform for web scraping and data extraction, which provides an [ecosystem](https://apify.com/store) of more than a thousand ready-made apps called *Actors* for various web scraping, crawling, and data extraction use cases. For example, you can use it to extract Google Search results, Instagram and Facebook profiles, products from Amazon or Shopify, Google Maps reviews, etc. etc.  In this example, we'll use the [Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler) Actor, which can deeply crawl websites such as documentation, knowledge bases, help centers, or blogs, and extract text content from the web pages. Then we feed the documents into a vector index and answer questions from it. 
Here is some code:
#!pip install apify-client

First, import `ApifyWrapper` into your source code: 
Here is some code:
from langchain.document_loaders.base import Document
from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator
from langchain.utilities import ApifyWrapper

Initialize it using your [Apify API token](https://console.apify.com/account/integrations) and for the purpose of this example, also with your OpenAI API key: 
Here is some code:
import os
os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = ""Your OpenAI API key""
os.environ[""APIFY_API_TOKEN""] = ""Your Apify API token""

apify = ApifyWrapper()

Then run the Actor, wait for it to finish, and fetch its results from the Apify dataset into a LangChain document loader.  Note that if you already have some results in an Apify dataset, you can load them directly using `ApifyDatasetLoader`, as shown in [this notebook](../../../indexes/document_loaders/examples/apify_dataset.ipynb). In that notebook, you'll also find the explanation of the `dataset_mapping_function`, which is used to map fields from the Apify dataset records to LangChain `Document` fields. 
Here is some code:
loader = apify.call_actor(
    actor_id=""apify/website-content-crawler"",
    run_input={""startUrls"": [{""url"": ""https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/""}]},
    dataset_mapping_function=lambda item: Document(
        page_content=item[""text""] or """", metadata={""source"": item[""url""]}
    ),
)

Initialize the vector index from the crawled documents: 
Here is some code:
index = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader])

And finally, query the vector index: 
Here is some code:
query = ""What is LangChain?""
result = index.query_with_sources(query)

NLA supports apps like Gmail, Salesforce, Trello, Slack, Asana, HubSpot, Google Sheets, Microsoft Teams, and thousands more apps: https://zapier.com/apps  Zapier NLA handles ALL the underlying API auth and translation from natural language --> underlying API call --> return simplified output for LLMs. The key idea is you, or your users, expose a set of actions via an oauth-like setup window, which you can then query and execute via a REST API.  NLA offers both API Key and OAuth for signing NLA API requests.  1. Server-side (API Key): for quickly getting started, testing, and production scenarios where LangChain will only use actions exposed in the developer's Zapier account (and will use the developer's connected accounts on Zapier.com)  2.

An LLM chat agent consists of three parts:  - PromptTemplate: This is the prompt template that can be used to instruct the language model on what to do - ChatModel: This is the language model that powers the agent - `stop` sequence: Instructs the LLM to stop generating as soon as this string is found - OutputParser: This determines how to parse the LLMOutput into an AgentAction or AgentFinish object   The LLMAgent is used in an AgentExecutor. This AgentExecutor can largely be thought of as a loop that: 1. Passes user input and any previous steps to the Agent (in this case, the LLMAgent) 2. If the Agent returns an `AgentFinish`, then return that directly to the user 3. If the Agent returns an `AgentAction`, then use that to call a tool and get an `Observation` 4. Repeat, passing the `AgentAction` and `Observation` back to the Agent until an `AgentFinish` is emitted.      `AgentAction` is a response that consists of `action` and `action_input`. `action` refers to which tool to use, and `action_input` refers to the input to that tool. `log` can also be provided as more context (that can be used for logging, tracing, etc).  `AgentFinish` is a response that contains the final message to be sent back to the user.

In this notebook we walk through how to create a custom MRKL agent by creating a custom LLMChain. 
",118,langchain/docs/modules/agents/agents/custom_mrkl_agent.ipynb
131,131,"### Custom LLMChain  The first way to create a custom agent is to use an existing Agent class, but use a custom LLMChain. This is the simplest way to create a custom Agent. It is highly recommended that you work with the `ZeroShotAgent`, as at the moment that is by far the most generalizable one.   Most of the work in creating the custom LLMChain comes down to the prompt. Because we are using an existing agent class to parse the output, it is very important that the prompt say to produce text in that format. Additionally, we currently require an `agent_scratchpad` input variable to put notes on previous actions and observations. This should almost always be the final part of the prompt. However, besides those instructions, you can customize the prompt as you wish.  To ensure that the prompt contains the appropriate instructions, we will utilize a helper method on that class. The helper method for the `ZeroShotAgent` takes the following arguments:  - tools: List of tools the agent will have access to, used to format the prompt. - prefix: String to put before the list of tools. - suffix: String to put after the list of tools. - input_variables: List of input variables the final prompt will expect.  For this exercise, we will give our agent access to Google Search, and we will customize it in that we will have it answer as a pirate. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.agents import ZeroShotAgent, Tool, AgentExecutor
from langchain import OpenAI, SerpAPIWrapper, LLMChain

search = SerpAPIWrapper()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name = ""Search"",
        func=search.run,
        description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events""
    )
]

prefix = """"""Answer the following questions as best you can, but speaking as a pirate might speak. You have access to the following tools:""""""
suffix = """"""Begin! Remember to speak as a pirate when giving your final answer. Use lots of ""Args""

Question: {input}

prompt = ZeroShotAgent.create_prompt(
    tools, 
    prefix=prefix, 
    suffix=suffix, 
    input_variables=[""input"", ""agent_scratchpad""]
)

In case we are curious, we can now take a look at the final prompt template to see what it looks like when its all put together. 
Here is some code:
print(prompt.template)

Note that we are able to feed agents a self-defined prompt template, i.e. not restricted to the prompt generated by the `create_prompt` function, assuming it meets the agent's requirements.   For example, for `ZeroShotAgent`, we will need to ensure that it meets the following requirements. There should a string starting with ""Action:"" and a following string starting with ""Action Input:"", and both should be separated by a newline. 
Here is some code:
llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), prompt=prompt)

tool_names = [tool.name for tool in tools]
agent = ZeroShotAgent(llm_chain=llm_chain, allowed_tools=tool_names)

The novel idea introduced in this notebook is the idea of using retrieval to select the set of tools to use to answer an agent query. This is useful when you have many many tools to select from. You cannot put the description of all the tools in the prompt (because of context length issues) so instead you dynamically select the N tools you do want to consider using at run time.  In this notebook we will create a somewhat contrieved example. We will have one legitimate tool (search) and then 99 fake tools which are just nonsense. We will then add a step in the prompt template that takes the user input and retrieves tool relevant to the query.

An LLM agent consists of three parts:  - PromptTemplate: This is the prompt template that can be used to instruct the language model on what to do - LLM: This is the language model that powers the agent - `stop` sequence: Instructs the LLM to stop generating as soon as this string is found - OutputParser: This determines how to parse the LLMOutput into an AgentAction or AgentFinish object   The LLMAgent is used in an AgentExecutor. This AgentExecutor can largely be thought of as a loop that: 1. Passes user input and any previous steps to the Agent (in this case, the LLMAgent) 2. If the Agent returns an `AgentFinish`, then return that directly to the user 3. If the Agent returns an `AgentAction`, then use that to call a tool and get an `Observation` 4. Repeat, passing the `AgentAction` and `Observation` back to the Agent until an `AgentFinish` is emitted.      `AgentAction` is a response that consists of `action` and `action_input`. `action` refers to which tool to use, and `action_input` refers to the input to that tool. `log` can also be provided as more context (that can be used for logging, tracing, etc).  `AgentFinish` is a response that contains the final message to be sent back to the user. This should be used to end an agent run.          In this notebook we walk through how to create a custom LLM agent.

The idea is simple: to get coherent agent behavior over long sequences behavior & to save on tokens, we'll separate concerns: a ""planner"" will be responsible for what endpoints to call and a ""controller"" will be responsible for how to call them.  In the initial implementation, the planner is an LLM chain that has the name and a short description for each endpoint in context.

You can do this with multiple different vectordbs, and use the agent as a way to route between them.

220,220,"# How to use the async API for Agents  LangChain provides async support for Agents by leveraging the [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) library.  Async methods are currently supported for the following `Tools`: [`GoogleSerperAPIWrapper`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/utilities/google_serper.py), [`SerpAPIWrapper`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/serpapi.py) and [`LLMMathChain`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/chains/llm_math/base.py). Async support for other agent tools are on the roadmap.  For `Tool`s that have a `coroutine` implemented (the three mentioned above), the `AgentExecutor` will `await` them directly. Otherwise, the `AgentExecutor` will call the `Tool`'s `func` via `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor` to avoid blocking the main runloop.  You can use `arun` to call an `AgentExecutor` asynchronously.

Here is some code:
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain
from langchain.prompts.chat import (
    ChatPromptTemplate,
    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,
    AIMessagePromptTemplate,
    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,
)
from langchain.schema import (
    AIMessage,
    HumanMessage,
    SystemMessage
)

chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)

You can get chat completions by passing one or more messages to the chat model. The response will be a message. The types of messages currently supported in LangChain are `AIMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `SystemMessage`, and `ChatMessage` -- `ChatMessage` takes in an arbitrary role parameter. Most of the time, you'll just be dealing with `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, and `SystemMessage` 
Here is some code:
chat([HumanMessage(content=""Translate this sentence from English to French. I love programming."")])

OpenAI's chat model supports multiple messages as input. See [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/chat-vs-completions) for more information. Here is an example of sending a system and user message to the chat model: 
Here is some code:
messages = [
    SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.""),
    HumanMessage(content=""I love programming."")
]
chat(messages)

You can go one step further and generate completions for multiple sets of messages using `generate`. This returns an `LLMResult` with an additional `message` parameter. 
Here is some code:
batch_messages = [
    [
        SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.""),
        HumanMessage(content=""I love programming."")
    ],
    [
        SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.""),
        HumanMessage(content=""I love artificial intelligence."")
    ],

result.llm_output

243,243,"## PromptTemplates 
You can make use of templating by using a `MessagePromptTemplate`. You can build a `ChatPromptTemplate` from one or more `MessagePromptTemplates`. You can use `ChatPromptTemplate`'s `format_prompt` -- this returns a `PromptValue`, which you can convert to a string or Message object, depending on whether you want to use the formatted value as input to an llm or chat model.  For convenience, there is a `from_template` method exposed on the template. If you were to use this template, this is what it would look like: 
Here is some code:
template=""You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}.""
system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)
human_template=""{text}""
human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)

chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])

# get a chat completion from the formatted messages
chat(chat_prompt.format_prompt(input_language=""English"", output_language=""French"", text=""I love programming."").to_messages())

If you wanted to construct the MessagePromptTemplate more directly, you could create a PromptTemplate outside and then pass it in, eg: 
Here is some code:
prompt=PromptTemplate(
    template=""You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}."",
    input_variables=[""input_language"", ""output_language""],

You can use `ChatPromptTemplate`'s `format_prompt` -- this returns a `PromptValue`, which you can convert to a string or Message object, depending on whether you want to use the formatted value as input to an llm or chat model.  For convenience, there is a `from_template` method exposed on the template. If you were to use this template, this is what it would look like: 
Here is some code:
template=""You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}.""
system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)
human_template=""{text}""
human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)

chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])

# get a chat completion from the formatted messages
chat(chat_prompt.format_prompt(input_language=""English"", output_language=""French"", text=""I love programming."").to_messages())

260,260,"# Getting Started  This notebook goes over how to use the LLM class in LangChain.  The LLM class is a class designed for interfacing with LLMs. There are lots of LLM providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) - this class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them. In this part of the documentation, we will focus on generic LLM functionality. For details on working with a specific LLM wrapper, please see the examples in the [How-To section](how_to_guides.rst).  For this notebook, we will work with an OpenAI LLM wrapper, although the functionalities highlighted are generic for all LLM types. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-ada-001"", n=2, best_of=2)

**Generate Text:** The most basic functionality an LLM has is just the ability to call it, passing in a string and getting back a string. 
Here is some code:
llm(""Tell me a joke"")

**Generate:** More broadly, you can call it with a list of inputs, getting back a more complete response than just the text. This complete response includes things like multiple top responses, as well as LLM provider specific information 
Here is some code:
llm_result = llm.generate([""Tell me a joke"", ""Tell me a poem""]*15)

len(llm_result.generations)

llm_result.generations[0]

llm_result.generations[-1]

You can also access provider specific information that is returned. This information is NOT standardized across providers. 
Here is some code:
llm_result.llm_output

**Number of Tokens:** You can also estimate how many tokens a piece of text will be in that model. This is useful because models have a context length (and cost more for more tokens), which means you need to be aware of how long the text you are passing in is.  Notice that by default the tokens are estimated using [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) (except for legacy version <3.8, where a Hugging Face tokenizer is used) 
Here is some code:
llm.get_num_tokens(""what a joke"")

298,298,"# Azure OpenAI  This notebook goes over how to use Langchain with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/azure-openai).  The Azure OpenAI API is compatible with OpenAI's API.  The `openai` Python package makes it easy to use both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.  You can call Azure OpenAI the same way you call OpenAI with the exceptions noted below.  ## API configuration You can configure the `openai` package to use Azure OpenAI using environment variables.  The following is for `bash`:  ```bash # Set this to `azure` export OPENAI_API_TYPE=azure # The API version you want to use: set this to `2022-12-01` for the released version. export OPENAI_API_VERSION=2022-12-01 # The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource. export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com # The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource. export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI API key> ```  Alternatively, you can configure the API right within your running Python environment:  ```python import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_TYPE""] = ""azure"" ... ```  ## Deployments With Azure OpenAI, you set up your own deployments of the common GPT-3 and Codex models.  When calling the API, you need to specify the deployment you want to use.  Let's say your deployment name is `text-davinci-002-prod`.  In the `openai` Python API, you can specify this deployment with the `engine` parameter.  For example:  ```python import openai  response = openai.Completion.create(     engine=""text-davinci-002-prod"",     prompt=""This is a test"",     max_tokens=5 ) ``` 
Here is some code:
!pip install openai

import os
os.environ[""OPENAI_API_TYPE""] = ""azure""
os.environ[""OPENAI_API_VERSION""] = ""2022-12-01""
os.environ[""OPENAI_API_BASE""] = ""...""
os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = ""...""

# Import Azure OpenAI
from langchain.llms import AzureOpenAI

# Create an instance of Azure OpenAI
# Replace the deployment name with your own
llm = AzureOpenAI(
    deployment_name=""td2"",
    model_name=""text-davinci-002"", 
)

# Run the LLM

We can also print the LLM and see its custom print.

See the [Runhouse docs](https://runhouse-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/).

llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)

question = ""What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Beiber was born?""

llm_chain.run(question)

You can also load more custom models through the SelfHostedHuggingFaceLLM interface: 
Here is some code:
llm = SelfHostedHuggingFaceLLM(
    model_id=""google/flan-t5-small"",
    task=""text2text-generation"",
    hardware=gpu,
)

llm(""What is the capital of Germany?"")

Using a custom load function, we can load a custom pipeline directly on the remote hardware: 
Here is some code:
def load_pipeline():
    from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline  # Need to be inside the fn in notebooks
    model_id = ""gpt2""
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)
    pipe = pipeline(
        ""text-generation"", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, max_new_tokens=10
    )
    return pipe

def inference_fn(pipeline, prompt, stop = None):
    return pipeline(prompt)[0][""generated_text""][len(prompt):]

llm = SelfHostedHuggingFaceLLM(model_load_fn=load_pipeline, hardware=gpu, inference_fn=inference_fn)

llm(""Who is the current US president?"")

You can send your pipeline directly over the wire to your model, but this will only work for small models (<2 Gb), and will be pretty slow: 
Here is some code:
pipeline = load_pipeline()
llm = SelfHostedPipeline.from_pipeline(
    pipeline=pipeline, hardware=gpu, model_reqs=model_reqs
)

Instead, we can also send it to the hardware's filesystem, which will be much faster. 
Here is some code:
rh.blob(pickle.dumps(pipeline), path=""models/pipeline.pkl"").save().to(gpu, path=""models"")

llm = SelfHostedPipeline.from_pipeline(pipeline=""models/pipeline.pkl"", hardware=gpu)

To utilize streaming, use a [`CallbackHandler`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/callbacks/base.py) that implements `on_llm_new_token`. In this example, we are using [`StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler`]().

Currently, `OpenAI`, `PromptLayerOpenAI`, `ChatOpenAI` and `Anthropic` are supported, but async support for other LLMs is on the roadmap.

379,379,"# Chat Prompt Template  [Chat Models](../models/chat.rst) takes a list of chat messages as input - this list commonly referred to as a prompt. These chat messages differ from raw string (which you would pass into a [LLM](../models/llms.rst) model) in that every message is associated with a role.  For example, in OpenAI [Chat Completion API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction), a chat message can be associated with the AI, human or system role. The model is supposed to follow instruction from system chat message more closely.  Therefore, LangChain provides several related prompt templates to make constructing and working with prompts easily. You are encouraged to use these chat related prompt templates instead of `PromptTemplate` when querying chat models to fully exploit the potential of underlying chat model. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.prompts import (
    ChatPromptTemplate,
    PromptTemplate,
    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,
    AIMessagePromptTemplate,
    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,
)
from langchain.schema import (
    AIMessage,
    HumanMessage,
    SystemMessage
)

To create a message template associated with a role, you use `MessagePromptTemplate`.   For convenience, there is a `from_template` method exposed on the template. If you were to use this template, this is what it would look like: 
Here is some code:
template=""You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}.""
system_message_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(template)
human_template=""{text}""
human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)

If you wanted to construct the `MessagePromptTemplate` more directly, you could create a PromptTemplate outside and then pass it in, eg: 
Here is some code:
prompt=PromptTemplate(
    template=""You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}."",
    input_variables=[""input_language"", ""output_language""],
)
system_message_prompt_2 = SystemMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=prompt)

assert system_message_prompt == system_message_prompt_2

After that, you can build a `ChatPromptTemplate` from one or more `MessagePromptTemplates`. You can use `ChatPromptTemplate`'s `format_prompt` -- this returns a `PromptValue`, which you can convert to a string or Message object, depending on whether you want to use the formatted value as input to an llm or chat model. 
Here is some code:
chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt])

# get a chat completion from the formatted messages
chat_prompt.format_prompt(input_language=""English"", output_language=""French"", text=""I love programming."").to_messages()

# or alternatively

",161,langchain/docs/modules/prompts/chat_prompt_template.ipynb
381,381,"## Different types of `MessagePromptTemplate`  LangChain provides different types of `MessagePromptTemplate`. The most commonly used are `AIMessagePromptTemplate`, `SystemMessagePromptTemplate` and `HumanMessagePromptTemplate`, which create an AI message, system message and human message respectively.  However, in cases where the chat model supports taking chat message with arbitrary role, you can use `ChatMessagePromptTemplate`, which allows user to specify the role name. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.prompts import ChatMessagePromptTemplate

prompt = ""May the {subject} be with you""

chat_message_prompt = ChatMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(role=""Jedi"", template=prompt)
chat_message_prompt.format(subject=""force"")

LangChain also provides `MessagesPlaceholder`, which gives you full control of what messages to be rendered during formatting. This can be useful when you are uncertain of what role you should be using for your message prompt templates or when you wish to insert a list of messages during formatting. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder

386,386,"# Output Parsers  Language models output text. But many times you may want to get more structured information than just text back. This is where output parsers come in.  Output parsers are classes that help structure language model responses. There are two main methods an output parser must implement:  - `get_format_instructions() -> str`: A method which returns a string containing instructions for how the output of a language model should be formatted. - `parse(str) -> Any`: A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and parses it into some structure.  And then one optional one:  - `parse_with_prompt(str, PromptValue) -> Any`: A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and a prompt (assumed to the prompt that generated such a response) and parses it into some structure. The prompt is largely provided in the event the OutputParser wants to retry or fix the output in some way, and needs information from the prompt to do so.   Below we go over the main type of output parser, the `PydanticOutputParser`. See the `examples` folder for other options. 
Here is some code:

from langchain.output_parsers import StructuredOutputParser, ResponseSchema
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate, ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

Here we define the response schema we want to receive. 
Here is some code:
response_schemas = [
    ResponseSchema(name=""answer"", description=""answer to the user's question""),
    ResponseSchema(name=""source"", description=""source used to answer the user's question, should be a website."")
]
output_parser = StructuredOutputParser.from_response_schemas(response_schemas)

We now get a string that contains instructions for how the response should be formatted, and we then insert that into our prompt. 
Here is some code:
format_instructions = output_parser.get_format_instructions()
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template=""answer the users question as best as possible.\n{format_instructions}\n{question}"",
    input_variables=[""question""],
    partial_variables={""format_instructions"": format_instructions}
)

We can now use this to format a prompt to send to the language model, and then parse the returned result. 
Here is some code:
model = OpenAI(temperature=0)

_input = prompt.format_prompt(question=""what's the capital of france"")
output = model(_input.to_string())

output_parser.parse(output)

392,392,"# How to work with partial Prompt Templates  A prompt template is a class with a `.format` method which takes in a key-value map and returns a string (a prompt) to pass to the language model. Like other methods, it can make sense to ""partial"" a prompt template - eg pass in a subset of the required values, as to create a new prompt template which expects only the remaining subset of values.  LangChain supports this in two ways: we allow for partially formatted prompts (1) with string values, (2) with functions that return string values. These two different ways support different use cases. In the documentation below we go over the motivations for both use cases as well as how to do it in LangChain.  ## Partial With Strings  One common use case for wanting to partial a prompt template is if you get some of the variables before others. For example, suppose you have a prompt template that requires two variables, `foo` and `baz`. If you get the `foo` value early on in the chain, but the `baz` value later, it can be annoying to wait until you have both variables in the same place to pass them to the prompt template. Instead, you can partial the prompt template with the `foo` value, and then pass the partialed prompt template along and just use that. Below is an example of doing this: 
Here is some code:
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

prompt = PromptTemplate(template=""{foo}{bar}"", input_variables=[""foo"", ""bar""])
partial_prompt = prompt.partial(foo=""foo"");
print(partial_prompt.format(bar=""baz""))

You can also just initialize the prompt with the partialed variables. 
Here is some code:
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=""{foo}{bar}"", input_variables=[""bar""], partial_variables={""foo"": ""foo""})
print(prompt.format(bar=""baz""))

",383,langchain/docs/modules/prompts/prompt_templates/examples/partial.ipynb
393,393,"## Partial With Functions  The other common use is to partial with a function. The use case for this is when you have a variable you know that you always want to fetch in a common way. A prime example of this is with date or time. Imagine you have a prompt which you always want to have the current date. You can't hard code it in the prompt, and passing it along with the other input variables is a bit annoying. In this case, it's very handy to be able to partial the prompt with a function that always returns the current date. 
Here is some code:
from datetime import datetime

def _get_datetime():
    now = datetime.now()
    return now.strftime(""%m/%d/%Y, %H:%M:%S"")

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about the day {date}"", 
    input_variables=[""adjective"", ""date""]
);
partial_prompt = prompt.partial(date=_get_datetime)
print(partial_prompt.format(adjective=""funny""))

You can also just initialize the prompt with the partialed variables, which often makes more sense in this workflow. 
Here is some code:
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about the day {date}"", 
    input_variables=[""adjective""],
    partial_variables={""date"": _get_datetime}

To achieve this task, we will create a custom prompt template that takes in the function name as input, and formats the prompt template to provide the source code of the function.  ## Why are custom prompt templates needed?  LangChain provides a set of default prompt templates that can be used to generate prompts for a variety of tasks. However, there may be cases where the default prompt templates do not meet your needs. For example, you may want to create a prompt template with specific dynamic instructions for your language model. In such cases, you can create a custom prompt template.  Take a look at the current set of default prompt templates [here](../getting_started.md).

409,409,"## Creating a Custom Prompt Template  There are essentially two distinct prompt templates available - string prompt templates and chat prompt templates. String prompt templates provides a simple prompt in string format, while chat prompt templates produces a more structured prompt to be used with a chat API.  In this guide, we will create a custom prompt using a string prompt template.   To create a custom string prompt template, there are two requirements: 1. It has an input_variables attribute that exposes what input variables the prompt template expects. 2. It exposes a format method that takes in keyword arguments corresponding to the expected input_variables and returns the formatted prompt.  We will create a custom prompt template that takes in the function name as input and formats the prompt to provide the source code of the function. To achieve this, let's first create a function that will return the source code of a function given its name. 
Here is some code:
import inspect

def get_source_code(function_name):
    # Get the source code of the function
    return inspect.getsource(function_name)

This notebook covers how to do that in LangChain, walking through all the different types of prompts and the different serialization options.  At a high level, the following design principles are applied to serialization:  1. Both JSON and YAML are supported. We want to support serialization methods that are human readable on disk, and YAML and JSON are two of the most popular methods for that. Note that this rule applies to prompts. For other assets, like Examples, different serialization methods may be supported.  2. We support specifying everything in one file, or storing different components (templates, examples, etc) in different files and referencing them. For some cases, storing everything in file makes the most sense, but for others it is preferrable to split up some of the assets (long templates, large examples, reusable components). LangChain supports both.  There is also a single entry point to load prompts from disk, making it easy to load any type of prompt.

Chains allow us to combine multiple components together to create a single, coherent application. For example, we can create a chain that takes user input, formats it with a PromptTemplate, and then passes the formatted response to an LLM. We can build more complex chains by combining multiple chains together, or by combining chains with other components. 
",139,langchain/docs/modules/chains/getting_started.ipynb
430,430,"## Quick start: Using `LLMChain`  The `LLMChain` is a simple chain that takes in a prompt template, formats it with the user input and returns the response from an LLM.   To use the `LLMChain`, first create a prompt template. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=[""product""],
    template=""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"",
)

We can now create a very simple chain that will take user input, format the prompt with it, and then send it to the LLM. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# Run the chain only specifying the input variable.
print(chain.run(""colorful socks""))

You can use a chat model in an `LLMChain` as well: 
Here is some code:
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts.chat import (
    ChatPromptTemplate,
    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,
)
human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate(
        prompt=PromptTemplate(
            template=""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"",
            input_variables=[""product""],
        )
    )

chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.9)
chain = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=chat_prompt_template)
print(chain.run(""colorful socks""))

",345,langchain/docs/modules/chains/getting_started.ipynb
431,431,"## Different ways of calling chains  All classes inherited from `Chain` offer a few ways of running chain logic. The most direct one is by using `__call__`: 
Here is some code:
chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
prompt_template = ""Tell me a {adjective} joke""
llm_chain = LLMChain(
    llm=chat,
    prompt=PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template)
)

llm_chain(inputs={""adjective"":""corny""})

By default, `__call__` returns both the input and output key values. You can configure it to only return output key values by setting `return_only_outputs` to `True`. 
Here is some code:
llm_chain(""corny"", return_only_outputs=True)

If the `Chain` only outputs one output key (i.e. only has one element in its `output_keys`), you can  use `run` method. Note that `run` outputs a string instead of a dictionary. 
Here is some code:
# llm_chain only has one output key, so we can use run
llm_chain.output_keys

llm_chain.run({""adjective"":""corny""})

In the case of one input key, you can input the string directly without specifying the input mapping. 
Here is some code:
# These two are equivalent
llm_chain.run({""adjective"":""corny""})
llm_chain.run(""corny"")

# These two are also equivalent
llm_chain(""corny"")
llm_chain({""adjective"":""corny""})

Tips: You can easily integrate a `Chain` object as a `Tool` in your `Agent` via its `run` method. See an example [here](../agents/tools/custom_tools.ipynb). 
",364,langchain/docs/modules/chains/getting_started.ipynb
432,432,"## Add memory to chains  `Chain` supports taking a `BaseMemory` object as its `memory` argument, allowing `Chain` object to persist data across multiple calls. In other words, it makes `Chain` a stateful object. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=chat,
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory()

# -> The first three colors of a rainbow are red, orange, and yellow.
conversation.run(""And the next 4?"")
# -> The next four colors of a rainbow are green, blue, indigo, and violet.

Essentially, `BaseMemory` defines an interface of how `langchain` stores memory. It allows reading of stored data through `load_memory_variables` method and storing new data through `save_context` method. You can learn more about it in [Memory](../memory/getting_started.ipynb) section.

434,434,"## Combine chains with the `SequentialChain`  The next step after calling a language model is to make a series of calls to a language model. We can do this using sequential chains, which are chains that execute their links in a predefined order. Specifically, we will use the `SimpleSequentialChain`. This is the simplest type of a sequential chain, where each step has a single input/output, and the output of one step is the input to the next.  In this tutorial, our sequential chain will: 1. First, create a company name for a product. We will reuse the `LLMChain` we'd previously initialized to create this company name. 2. Then, create a catchphrase for the product. We will initialize a new `LLMChain` to create this catchphrase, as shown below. 
Here is some code:
second_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=[""company_name""],
    template=""Write a catchphrase for the following company: {company_name}"",
)
chain_two = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=second_prompt)

Now we can combine the two LLMChains, so that we can create a company name and a catchphrase in a single step. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.chains import SimpleSequentialChain
overall_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(chains=[chain, chain_two], verbose=True)

Fill out the `input_keys` and `output_keys` properties, 3. Add the `_call` method that shows how to execute the chain.  These steps are demonstrated in the example below: 
Here is some code:

        all_input_vars = set(self.chain_1.input_keys).union(set(self.chain_2.input_keys))
        return list(all_input_vars)

    @property

436,436,"# Hypothetical Document Embeddings This notebook goes over how to use Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE), as described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496).   At a high level, HyDE is an embedding technique that takes queries, generates a hypothetical answer, and then embeds that generated document and uses that as the final example.   In order to use HyDE, we therefore need to provide a base embedding model, as well as an LLMChain that can be used to generate those documents. By default, the HyDE class comes with some default prompts to use (see the paper for more details on them), but we can also create our own. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.chains import LLMChain, HypotheticalDocumentEmbedder
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

base_embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
llm = OpenAI()


Here is some code:
# Load with `web_search` prompt
embeddings = HypotheticalDocumentEmbedder.from_llm(llm, base_embeddings, ""web_search"")

# Now we can use it as any embedding class!
result = embeddings.embed_query(""Where is the Taj Mahal?"")

",274,langchain/docs/modules/chains/index_examples/hyde.ipynb
437,437,"## Multiple generations We can also generate multiple documents and then combine the embeddings for those. By default, we combine those by taking the average. We can do this by changing the LLM we use to generate documents to return multiple things. 
Here is some code:
multi_llm = OpenAI(n=4, best_of=4)

embeddings = HypotheticalDocumentEmbedder.from_llm(multi_llm, base_embeddings, ""web_search"")

result = embeddings.embed_query(""Where is the Taj Mahal?"")

",106,langchain/docs/modules/chains/index_examples/hyde.ipynb
438,438,"## Using our own prompts Besides using preconfigured prompts, we can also easily construct our own prompts and use those in the LLMChain that is generating the documents. This can be useful if we know the domain our queries will be in, as we can condition the prompt to generate text more similar to that.  In the example below, let's condition it to generate text about a state of the union address (because we will use that in the next example). 
Here is some code:
prompt_template = """"""Please answer the user's question about the most recent state of the union address

prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[""question""], template=prompt_template)

441,441,"## Chain Type You can easily specify different chain types to load and use in the RetrievalQA chain. For a more detailed walkthrough of these types, please see [this notebook](question_answering.ipynb).  There are two ways to load different chain types. First, you can specify the chain type argument in the `from_chain_type` method. This allows you to pass in the name of the chain type you want to use. For example, in the below we change the chain type to `map_reduce`. 
Here is some code:
qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type=""map_reduce"", retriever=docsearch.as_retriever())

query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
qa.run(query)

The above way allows you to really simply change the chain_type, but it does provide a ton of flexibility over parameters to that chain type. If you want to control those parameters, you can load the chain directly (as you did in [this notebook](question_answering.ipynb)) and then pass that directly to the the RetrievalQA chain with the `combine_documents_chain` parameter. For example: 
Here is some code:

For example, in the below we change the chain type to `map_reduce`. 
Here is some code:
chain = RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain.from_chain_type(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type=""map_reduce"", retriever=docsearch.as_retriever())

chain({""question"": ""What did the president say about Justice Breyer""}, return_only_outputs=True)

The above way allows you to really simply change the chain_type, but it does provide a ton of flexibility over parameters to that chain type. If you want to control those parameters, you can load the chain directly (as you did in [this notebook](qa_with_sources.ipynb)) and then pass that directly to the the RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain chain with the `combine_documents_chain` parameter. For example: 
Here is some code:
from langchain.chains.qa_with_sources import load_qa_with_sources_chain
qa_chain = load_qa_with_sources_chain(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type=""stuff"")
qa = RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain(combine_documents_chain=qa_chain, retriever=docsearch.as_retriever())

qa({""question"": ""What did the president say about Justice Breyer""}, return_only_outputs=True)

465,465,"# Chat Over Documents with Chat History  This notebook goes over how to set up a chain to chat over documents with chat history using a `ConversationalRetrievalChain`. The only difference between this chain and the [RetrievalQAChain](./vector_db_qa.ipynb) is that this allows for passing in of a chat history which can be used to allow for follow up questions. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain

Load in documents. You can replace this with a loader for whatever type of data you want 
Here is some code:
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
loader = TextLoader(""../../state_of_the_union.txt"")
documents = loader.load()

If you had multiple loaders that you wanted to combine, you do something like: 
Here is some code:
# loaders = [....]
# docs = []
# for loader in loaders:
#     docs.extend(loader.load())

We now split the documents, create embeddings for them, and put them in a vectorstore. This allows us to do semantic search over them. 
Here is some code:
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
documents = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents, embeddings)

We can now create a memory object, which is neccessary to track the inputs/outputs and hold a conversation. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True)

We now initialize the `ConversationalRetrievalChain` 
Here is some code:
qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), vectorstore.as_retriever(), memory=memory)

query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
result = qa({""question"": query})

result[""answer""]

query = ""Did he mention who she suceeded""
result = qa({""question"": query})

result['answer']

466,466,"## Pass in chat history  In the above example, we used a Memory object to track chat history. We can also just pass it in explicitly. In order to do this, we need to initialize a chain without any memory object.

491,491,"# Moderation This notebook walks through examples of how to use a moderation chain, and several common ways for doing so. Moderation chains are useful for detecting text that could be hateful, violent, etc. This can be useful to apply on both user input, but also on the output of a Language Model. Some API providers, like OpenAI, [specifically prohibit](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-policies/use-case-policy) you, or your end users, from generating some types of harmful content. To comply with this (and to just generally prevent your application from being harmful) you may often want to append a moderation chain to any LLMChains, in order to make sure any output the LLM generates is not harmful.  If the content passed into the moderation chain is harmful, there is not one best way to handle it, it probably depends on your application. Sometimes you may want to throw an error in the Chain (and have your application handle that). Other times, you may want to return something to the user explaining that the text was harmful. There could even be other ways to handle it! We will cover all these ways in this notebook.  In this notebook, we will show:  1. How to run any piece of text through a moderation chain. 2. How to append a Moderation chain to an LLMChain.

It has a few distinct differences from the `LLMCheckerChain`, in that it doesn't have any assumtions to the format of the input text (or summary). Additionally, as the LLMs like to hallucinate when fact checking or get confused by context, it is sometimes beneficial to run the checker multiple times.  It does this by feeding the rewritten ""True"" result back on itself, and checking the ""facts"" for truth.  As you can see from the examples below, this can be very effective in arriving at a generally true body of text.

# SQL Chain example  This example demonstrates the use of the `SQLDatabaseChain` for answering questions over a database. 
Under the hood, LangChain uses SQLAlchemy to connect to SQL databases. The `SQLDatabaseChain` can therefore be used with any SQL dialect supported by SQLAlchemy, such as MS SQL, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, and SQLite. Please refer to the SQLAlchemy documentation for more information about requirements for connecting to your database. For example, a connection to MySQL requires an appropriate connector such as PyMySQL. A URI for a MySQL connection might look like: `mysql+pymysql://user:pass@some_mysql_db_address/db_name`  This demonstration uses SQLite and the example Chinook database. To set it up, follow the instructions on https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/, placing the `.db` file in a notebooks folder at the root of this repository. 

Here is some code:
from langchain import OpenAI, SQLDatabase, SQLDatabaseChain

db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(""sqlite:///../../../../notebooks/Chinook.db"")
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, verbose=True)

**NOTE:** For data-sensitive projects, you can specify `return_direct=True` in the `SQLDatabaseChain` initialization to directly return the output of the SQL query without any additional formatting. This prevents the LLM from seeing any contents within the database. Note, however, the LLM still has access to the database scheme (i.e. dialect, table and key names) by default. 
Here is some code:
db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True)

It is also possible to limit the columns that will be visible to the model if there are unnecessary columns.   This information can be provided as a dictionary with table names as the keys and table information as the values. For example, let's provide a custom definition and sample rows for the Track table with only a few columns:

519,519,"## Using Local Language Models 
Sometimes you may not have the luxury of using OpenAI or other service-hosted large language model. You can, ofcourse, try to use the `SQLDatabaseChain` with a local model, but will quickly realize that most models you can run locally even with a large GPU struggle to generate the right output. 
Here is some code:
import logging
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, GPT2TokenizerFast, pipeline, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoModelForCausalLM
from langchain import HuggingFacePipeline

# Note: This model requires a large GPU, e.g. an 80GB A100. See documentation for other ways to run private non-OpenAI models.
model_id = ""google/flan-ul2""
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_id, temperature=0)

device_id = -1  # default to no-GPU, but use GPU and half precision mode if available
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device_id = 0
    try:
        model = model.half()
    except RuntimeError as exc:
        logging.warn(f""Could not run model in half precision mode: {str(exc)}"")

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
pipe = pipeline(task=""text2text-generation"", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, max_length=1024, device=device_id)

local_llm = HuggingFacePipeline(pipeline=pipe)

from langchain import SQLDatabase, SQLDatabaseChain

db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(""sqlite:///../../../../notebooks/Chinook.db"", include_tables=['Customer'])
local_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(local_llm, db, verbose=True, return_intermediate_steps=True, use_query_checker=True)

This model should work for very simple SQL queries, as long as you use the query checker as specified above, e.g.: 
Here is some code:
local_chain(""How many customers are there?"")

Even this relatively large model will most likely fail to generate more complicated SQL by itself. However, you can log its inputs and outputs so that you can hand-correct them and use the corrected examples for few shot prompt examples later. In practice, you could log any executions of your chain that raise exceptions (as shown in the example below) or get direct user feedback in cases where the results are incorrect (but did not raise an exception). 
Here is some code:
!poetry run pip install pyyaml chromadb
import yaml

from typing import Dict

QUERY = ""List all the customer first names that start with 'a'""

def _parse_example(result: Dict) -> Dict:
    sql_cmd_key = ""sql_cmd""
    sql_result_key = ""sql_result""
    table_info_key = ""table_info""
    input_key = ""input""
    final_answer_key = ""answer""

    _example = {
        ""input"": result.get(""query""),
    }

    steps = result.get(""intermediate_steps"")
    answer_key = sql_cmd_key # the first one
    for step in steps:
        # The steps are in pairs, a dict (input) followed by a string (output).
        # Unfortunately there is no schema but you can look at the input key of the
        # dict to see what the output is supposed to be
        if isinstance(step, dict):
            # Grab the table info from input dicts in the intermediate steps once
            if table_info_key not in _example:
                _example[table_info_key] = step.get(table_info_key)

            if input_key in step:
                if step[input_key].endswith(""SQLQuery:""):
                    answer_key = sql_cmd_key # this is the SQL generation input
                if step[input_key].endswith(""Answer:""):
                    answer_key = final_answer_key # this is the final answer input
            elif sql_cmd_key in step:
                _example[sql_cmd_key] = step[sql_cmd_key]
                answer_key = sql_result_key # this is SQL execution input
        elif isinstance(step, str):
            # The preceding element should have set the answer_key
            _example[answer_key] = step
    return _example

example: any
try:
    result = local_chain(QUERY)
    print(""*** Query succeeded"")
    example = _parse_example(result)
except Exception as exc:
    print(""*** Query failed"")
    result = {
        ""query"": QUERY,
        ""intermediate_steps"": exc.intermediate_steps
    }
    example = _parse_example(result)


# print for now, in reality you may want to write this out to a YAML file or database for manual fix-ups offline
yaml_example = yaml.dump(example, allow_unicode=True)
print(""\n"" + yaml_example)

Run the snippet above a few times, or log exceptions in your deployed environment, to collect lots of examples of inputs, table_info and sql_cmd generated by your language model. The sql_cmd values will be incorrect and you can manually fix them up to build a collection of examples, e.g. here we are using YAML to keep a neat record of our inputs and corrected SQL output that we can build up over time. 
Here is some code:
YAML_EXAMPLES = """"""
- input: How many customers are not from Brazil?
  table_info: |
    CREATE TABLE ""Customer"" (
      ""CustomerId"" INTEGER NOT NULL, 
      ""FirstName"" NVARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,

      PRIMARY KEY (""CustomerId""), 
      FOREIGN KEY(""SupportRepId"") REFERENCES ""Employee"" (""EmployeeId"")
    )
  sql_cmd: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ""Customer"" WHERE NOT ""Country"" = ""Brazil"";
  sql_result: ""[(54,)]""
  answer: 54 customers are not from Brazil.

    )

    */
  sql_cmd: SELECT ""Name"" FROM ""Genre"" WHERE ""Name"" LIKE 'r%';
  sql_result: ""[('Rock',), ('Rock and Roll',), ('Reggae',), ('R&B/Soul',)]""
  answer: The genres that start with 'r' are Rock, Rock and Roll, Reggae and R&B/Soul. 
""""""

Now that you have some examples (with manually corrected output SQL), you can do few shot prompt seeding the usual way: 
Here is some code:
from langchain import FewShotPromptTemplate, PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains.sql_database.prompt import _sqlite_prompt, PROMPT_SUFFIX
from langchain.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain.prompts.example_selector.semantic_similarity import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

example_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=[""table_info"", ""input"", ""sql_cmd"", ""sql_result"", ""answer""],
    template=""{table_info}\n\nQuestion: {input}\nSQLQuery: {sql_cmd}\nSQLResult: {sql_result}\nAnswer: {answer}"",
)

examples_dict = yaml.safe_load(YAML_EXAMPLES)

local_embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=""sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"")

example_selector = SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector.from_examples(
                        # This is the list of examples available to select from.
                        examples_dict,
                        # This is the embedding class used to produce embeddings which are used to measure semantic similarity.
                        local_embeddings,
                        # This is the VectorStore class that is used to store the embeddings and do a similarity search over.
                        Chroma,  # type: ignore
                        # This is the number of examples to produce and include per prompt
                        k=min(3, len(examples_dict)),
                    )

few_shot_prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    example_selector=example_selector,
    example_prompt=example_prompt,
    prefix=_sqlite_prompt + ""Here are some examples:"",
    suffix=PROMPT_SUFFIX,
    input_variables=[""table_info"", ""input"", ""top_k""],
)

The model should do better now with this few shot prompt, especially for inputs similar to the examples you have seeded it with. 
Here is some code:
local_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(local_llm, db, prompt=few_shot_prompt, use_query_checker=True, verbose=True, return_intermediate_steps=True)

result = local_chain(""How many customers are from Brazil?"")

result = local_chain(""How many customers are there in total?"")

520,520,"# FLARE  This notebook is an implementation of Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE).  Please see the original repo [here](https://github.com/jzbjyb/FLARE/tree/main).  The basic idea is:  - Start answering a question - If you start generating tokens the model is uncertain about, look up relevant documents - Use those documents to continue generating - Repeat until finished  There is a lot of cool detail in how the lookup of relevant documents is done. Basically, the tokens that model is uncertain about are highlighted, and then an LLM is called to generate a question that would lead to that answer. For example, if the generated text is `Joe Biden went to Harvard`, and the tokens the model was uncertain about was `Harvard`, then a good generated question would be `where did Joe Biden go to college`. This generated question is then used in a retrieval step to fetch relevant documents.  In order to set up this chain, we will need three things:  - An LLM to generate the answer - An LLM to generate hypothetical questions to use in retrieval - A retriever to use to look up answers for  The LLM that we use to generate the answer needs to return logprobs so we can identify uncertain tokens. For that reason, we HIGHLY recommend that you use the OpenAI wrapper (NB: not the ChatOpenAI wrapper, as that does not return logprobs).  The LLM we use to generate hypothetical questions to use in retrieval can be anything. In this notebook we will use ChatOpenAI because it is fast and cheap.  The retriever can be anything. In this notebook we will use [SERPER](https://serper.dev/) search engine, because it is cheap.  Other important parameters to understand:  - `max_generation_len`: The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping to check if any are uncertain - `min_prob`: Any tokens generated with probability below this will be considered uncertain

`LLMChain` is perhaps one of the most popular ways of querying an LLM object. It formats the prompt template using the input key values provided (and also memory key values, if available), passes the formatted string to LLM and returns the LLM output. Below we show additional functionalities of `LLMChain` class. 
Here is some code:

prompt_template = ""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?""

Aside from `__call__` and `run` methods shared by all `Chain` object (see [Getting Started](../getting_started.ipynb) to learn more), `LLMChain` offers a few more ways of calling the chain logic: 
- `apply` allows you run the chain against a list of inputs: 
Here is some code:
input_list = [
    {""product"": ""socks""},
    {""product"": ""computer""},
    {""product"": ""shoes""}
]

llm_chain.apply(input_list)

- `generate` is similar to `apply`, except it return an `LLMResult` instead of string. `LLMResult` often contains useful generation such as token usages and finish reason. 
Here is some code:
llm_chain.generate(input_list)

- `predict` is similar to `run` method except that the input keys are specified as keyword arguments instead of a Python dict. 
Here is some code:
# Single input example
llm_chain.predict(product=""colorful socks"")

# Multiple inputs example

template = """"""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {subject}.""""""
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=[""adjective"", ""subject""])

By default, `LLMChain` does not parse the output even if the underlying `prompt` object has an output parser. If you would like to apply that output parser on the LLM output, use `predict_and_parse` instead of `predict` and `apply_and_parse` instead of `apply`.

There are two types of sequential chains:  - `SimpleSequentialChain`: The simplest form of sequential chains, where each step has a singular input/output, and the output of one step is the input to the next. - `SequentialChain`: A more general form of sequential chains, allowing for multiple inputs/outputs.

549,549,"# Getting Started  LangChain primary focuses on constructing indexes with the goal of using them as a Retriever. In order to best understand what this means, it's worth highlighting what the base Retriever interface is. The `BaseRetriever` class in LangChain is as follows: 
Here is some code:
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import List
from langchain.schema import Document

class BaseRetriever(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_relevant_documents(self, query: str) -> List[Document]:

            query: string to find relevant texts for

        Returns:
            List of relevant documents
        """"""

It's that simple! The `get_relevant_documents` method can be implemented however you see fit.  Of course, we also help construct what we think useful Retrievers are. The main type of Retriever that we focus on is a Vectorstore retriever. We will focus on that for the rest of this guide.  In order to understand what a vectorstore retriever is, it's important to understand what a Vectorstore is. So let's look at that. 
By default, LangChain uses [Chroma](../../ecosystem/chroma.md) as the vectorstore to index and search embeddings. To walk through this tutorial, we'll first need to install `chromadb`.  ``` pip install chromadb ```  This example showcases question answering over documents. We have chosen this as the example for getting started because it nicely combines a lot of different elements (Text splitters, embeddings, vectorstores) and then also shows how to use them in a chain.  Question answering over documents consists of four steps:  1. Create an index 2. Create a Retriever from that index 3. Create a question answering chain 4. Ask questions!  Each of the steps has multiple sub steps and potential configurations. In this notebook we will primarily focus on (1). We will start by showing the one-liner for doing so, but then break down what is actually going on.  First, let's import some common classes we'll use no matter what. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

Next in the generic setup, let's specify the document loader we want to use. You can download the `state_of_the_union.txt` file [here](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/docs/modules/state_of_the_union.txt) 
Here is some code:
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
loader = TextLoader('../state_of_the_union.txt', encoding='utf8')

",563,langchain/docs/modules/indexes/getting_started.ipynb
550,550,"## One Line Index Creation  To get started as quickly as possible, we can use the `VectorstoreIndexCreator`. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator

index = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader])

Now that the index is created, we can use it to ask questions of the data! Note that under the hood this is actually doing a few steps as well, which we will cover later in this guide. 
Here is some code:
query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
index.query(query)

query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
index.query_with_sources(query)

What is returned from the `VectorstoreIndexCreator` is `VectorStoreIndexWrapper`, which provides these nice `query` and `query_with_sources` functionality. If we just wanted to access the vectorstore directly, we can also do that. 
Here is some code:
index.vectorstore

If we then want to access the VectorstoreRetriever, we can do that with: 
Here is some code:
index.vectorstore.as_retriever()

",235,langchain/docs/modules/indexes/getting_started.ipynb
551,551,"## Walkthrough  Okay, so what's actually going on? How is this index getting created?  A lot of the magic is being hid in this `VectorstoreIndexCreator`. What is this doing?  There are three main steps going on after the documents are loaded:  1. Splitting documents into chunks 2. Creating embeddings for each document 3. Storing documents and embeddings in a vectorstore  Let's walk through this in code 
Here is some code:
documents = loader.load()

Next, we will split the documents into chunks. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

We will then select which embeddings we want to use. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

We now create the vectorstore to use as the index. 
Here is some code:
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
db = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings)

So that's creating the index. Then, we expose this index in a retriever interface. 
Here is some code:
retriever = db.as_retriever()

Then, as before, we create a chain and use it to answer questions! 
Here is some code:
qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type=""stuff"", retriever=retriever)

query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
qa.run(query)

`VectorstoreIndexCreator` is just a wrapper around all this logic. It is configurable in the text splitter it uses, the embeddings it uses, and the vectorstore it uses. For example, you can configure it as below: 
Here is some code:
index_creator = VectorstoreIndexCreator(
    vectorstore_cls=Chroma, 
    embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(),
    text_splitter=CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
)

Hopefully this highlights what is going on under the hood of `VectorstoreIndexCreator`. While we think it's important to have a simple way to create indexes, we also think it's important to understand what's going on under the hood.

# Stringing compressors and document transformers together Using the `DocumentCompressorPipeline` we can also easily combine multiple compressors in sequence. Along with compressors we can add `BaseDocumentTransformer`s to our pipeline, which don't perform any contextual compression but simply perform some transformation on a set of documents. For example `TextSplitter`s can be used as document transformers to split documents into smaller pieces, and the `EmbeddingsRedundantFilter` can be used to filter out redundant documents based on embedding similarity between documents.  Below we create a compressor pipeline by first splitting our docs into smaller chunks, then removing redundant documents, and then filtering based on relevance to the query.

Defaults to just counting number of characters, but it's pretty common to pass a token counter here. - `chunk_size`: the maximum size of your chunks (as measured by the length function). - `chunk_overlap`: the maximum overlap between chunks. It can be nice to have some overlap to maintain some continuity between chunks (eg do a sliding window).

\section{Introduction}
Large language models (LLMs) are a type of machine learning model that can be trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like language. In recent years, LLMs have made significant advances in a variety of natural language processing tasks, including language translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis.

\subsection{History of LLMs}
The earliest LLMs were developed in the 1980s and 1990s, but they were limited by the amount of data that could be processed and the computational power available at the time. In the past decade, however, advances in hardware and software have made it possible to train LLMs on massive datasets, leading to significant improvements in performance.

\subsection{Applications of LLMs}
LLMs have many applications in industry, including chatbots, content creation, and virtual assistants. They can also be used in academia for research in linguistics, psychology, and computational linguistics.

Check out [Elasticsearch installation instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html).  To connect to an Elasticsearch instance that does not require login credentials, pass the Elasticsearch URL and index name along with the embedding object to the constructor.  Example: ```python         from langchain import ElasticVectorSearch         from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings          embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()         elastic_vector_search = ElasticVectorSearch(             elasticsearch_url=""http://localhost:9200"",             index_name=""test_index"",             embedding=embedding         ) ```  To connect to an Elasticsearch instance that requires login credentials, including Elastic Cloud, use the Elasticsearch URL format https://username:password@es_host:9243. For example, to connect to Elastic Cloud, create the Elasticsearch URL with the required authentication details and pass it to the ElasticVectorSearch constructor as the named parameter elasticsearch_url.  You can obtain your Elastic Cloud URL and login credentials by logging in to the Elastic Cloud console at https://cloud.elastic.co, selecting your deployment, and navigating to the ""Deployments"" page.  To obtain your Elastic Cloud password for the default ""elastic"" user: 1. Log in to the Elastic Cloud console at https://cloud.elastic.co 2. Go to ""Security"" > ""Users"" 3. Locate the ""elastic"" user and click ""Edit"" 4. Click ""Reset password"" 5. Follow the prompts to reset the password  Format for Elastic Cloud URLs is https://username:password@cluster_id.region_id.gcp.cloud.es.io:9243.

This notebook showcases basic functionality related to `Deep Lake`. While `Deep Lake` can store embeddings, it is capable of storing any type of data. It is a fully fledged serverless data lake with version control, query engine and streaming dataloader to deep learning frameworks.

Create a dataset locally at `./deeplake/`, then run similiarity search. The Deeplake+LangChain integration uses Deep Lake datasets under the hood, so `dataset` and `vector store` are used interchangeably. To create a dataset in your own cloud, or in the Deep Lake storage, [adjust the path accordingly](https://docs.activeloop.ai/storage-and-credentials/storage-options).

It is an all-in-one workspace for notetaking, knowledge and data management, and project and task management.  `NotionDBLoader` is a Python class for loading content from a `Notion` database. It retrieves pages from the database, reads their content, and returns a list of Document objects.  ## Requirements  - A `Notion` Database - Notion Integration Token  ## Setup  ### 1. Create a Notion Table Database Create a new table database in Notion. You can add any column to the database and they will be treated as metadata. For example you can add the following columns:  - Title: set Title as the default property. - Categories: A Multi-select property to store categories associated with the page. - Keywords: A Multi-select property to store keywords associated with the page.  Add your content to the body of each page in the database. The NotionDBLoader will extract the content and metadata from these pages.  ## 2. Create a Notion Integration To create a Notion Integration, follow these steps:  1. Visit the [Notion Developers](https://www.notion.com/my-integrations) page and log in with your Notion account. 2. Click on the ""+ New integration"" button. 3. Give your integration a name and choose the workspace where your database is located. 4. Select the require capabilities, this extension only need the Read content capability 5. Click the ""Submit"" button to create the integration. Once the integration is created, you'll be provided with an `Integration Token (API key)`. Copy this token and keep it safe, as you'll need it to use the NotionDBLoader.  ### 3. Connect the Integration to the Database To connect your integration to the database, follow these steps:  1. Open your database in Notion. 2. Click on the three-dot menu icon in the top right corner of the database view. 3. Click on the ""+ New integration"" button. 4. Find your integration, you may need to start typing its name in the search box. 5. Click on the ""Connect"" button to connect the integration to the database.   ### 4. Get the Database ID To get the database ID, follow these steps:  1. Open your database in Notion. 2. Click on the three-dot menu icon in the top right corner of the database view. 3. Select ""Copy link"" from the menu to copy the database URL to your clipboard. 4. The database ID is the long string of alphanumeric characters found in the URL. It typically looks like this: https://www.notion.so/username/8935f9d140a04f95a872520c4f123456?v=.... In this example, the database ID is 8935f9d140a04f95a872520c4f123456.  With the database properly set up and the integration token and database ID in hand, you can now use the NotionDBLoader code to load content and metadata from your Notion database.  ## Usage NotionDBLoader is part of the langchain package's document loaders. You can use it as follows: 
Here is some code:
from getpass import getpass
NOTION_TOKEN = getpass()
DATABASE_ID = getpass()

from langchain.document_loaders import NotionDBLoader

loader = NotionDBLoader(
    integration_token=NOTION_TOKEN,

The `metadata` for each `Document` (really, a chunk of an actual PDF, DOC or DOCX) contains some useful additional information:  1. **id and name:** ID and Name of the file (PDF, DOC or DOCX) the chunk is sourced from within Docugami. 2. **xpath:** XPath inside the XML representation of the document, for the chunk. Useful for source citations directly to the actual chunk inside the document XML. 3. **structure:** Structural attributes of the chunk, e.g. h1, h2, div, table, td, etc. Useful to filter out certain kinds of chunks if needed by the caller. 4. **tag:** Semantic tag for the chunk, using various generative and extractive techniques.

730,730,"## Basic Use: Docugami Loader for Document QA  You can use the Docugami Loader like a standard loader for Document QA over multiple docs, albeit with much better chunks that follow the natural contours of the document. There are many great tutorials on how to do this, e.g. [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yPBVii7Ct0). We can just use the same code, but use the `DocugamiLoader` for better chunking, instead of loading text or PDF files directly with basic splitting techniques. 
Here is some code:
!poetry run pip -q install openai tiktoken chromadb 

from langchain.schema import Document
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

# For this example, we already have a processed docset for a set of lease documents
loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id=""wh2kned25uqm"")
documents = loader.load()

The documents returned by the loader are already split, so we don't need to use a text splitter. Optionally, we can use the metadata on each document, for example the structure or tag attributes, to do any post-processing we want.  We will just use the output of the `DocugamiLoader` as-is to set up a retrieval QA chain the usual way. 
Here is some code:
embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=documents, embedding=embedding)
retriever = vectordb.as_retriever()
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(), chain_type=""stuff"", retriever=retriever, return_source_documents=True
)

# Try out the retriever with an example query

731,731,"## Using Docugami to Add Metadata to Chunks for High Accuracy Document QA  One issue with large documents is that the correct answer to your question may depend on chunks that are far apart in the document. Typical chunking techniques, even with overlap, will struggle with providing the LLM sufficent context to answer such questions. With upcoming very large context LLMs, it may be possible to stuff a lot of tokens, perhaps even entire documents, inside the context but this will still hit limits at some point with very long documents, or a lot of documents.  For example, if we ask a more complex question that requires the LLM to draw on chunks from different parts of the document, even OpenAI's powerful LLM is unable to answer correctly. 
Here is some code:
chain_response = qa_chain(""What is rentable area for the property owned by DHA Group?"")
chain_response[""result""]  # the correct answer should be 13,500

At first glance the answer may seem reasonable, but if you review the source chunks carefully for this answer, you will see that the chunking of the document did not end up putting the Landlord name and the rentable area in the same context, since they are far apart in the document. The retriever therefore ends up finding unrelated chunks from other documents not even related to the **Menlo Group** landlord. That landlord happens to be mentioned on the first page of the file **Shorebucks LLC_NJ.pdf** file, and while one of the source chunks used by the chain is indeed from that doc that contains the correct answer (**13,500**), other source chunks from different docs are included, and the answer is therefore incorrect. 
Here is some code:
chain_response[""source_documents""]

Docugami can help here. Chunks are annotated with additional metadata created using different techniques if a user has been [using Docugami](https://help.docugami.com/home/reports). More technical approaches will be added later.  Specifically, let's look at the additional metadata that is returned on the documents returned by docugami, in the form of some simple key/value pairs on all the text chunks: 
Here is some code:
loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id=""wh2kned25uqm"")
documents = loader.load()
documents[0].metadata

We can use a [self-querying retriever](../../retrievers/examples/self_query_retriever.ipynb) to improve our query accuracy, using this additional metadata: 
Here is some code:
from langchain.chains.query_constructor.schema import AttributeInfo
from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever

EXCLUDE_KEYS = [""id"", ""xpath"", ""structure""]
metadata_field_info = [
    AttributeInfo(
        name=key,
        description=f""The {key} for this chunk"",
        type=""string"",
    )
    for key in documents[0].metadata
    if key.lower() not in EXCLUDE_KEYS
]


document_content_description = ""Contents of this chunk""
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=documents, embedding=embedding)
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm, vectordb, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True
)
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(), chain_type=""stuff"", retriever=retriever, return_source_documents=True
)

Let's run the same question again. It returns the correct result since all the chunks have metadata key/value pairs on them carrying key information about the document even if this infromation is physically very far away from the source chunk used to generate the answer. 
Here is some code:
qa_chain(""What is rentable area for the property owned by DHA Group?"")

This time the answer is correct, since the self-querying retriever created a filter on the landlord attribute of the metadata, correctly filtering to document that specifically is about the DHA Group landlord. The resulting source chunks are all relevant to this landlord, and this improves answer accuracy even though the landlord is not directly mentioned in the specific chunk that contains the correct answer.

This document loader does not currently support pagination, nor access to more complex objects which require additional parameters. It also requires a `resource` option which defines what objects you want to load.  Following resources are available: - `gateways_options`: [Documentation](https://docs.spreedly.com/reference/api/v1/#list-supported-gateways) - `gateways`: [Documentation](https://docs.spreedly.com/reference/api/v1/#list-created-gateways) - `receivers_options`: [Documentation](https://docs.spreedly.com/reference/api/v1/#list-supported-receivers) - `receivers`: [Documentation](https://docs.spreedly.com/reference/api/v1/#list-created-receivers) - `payment_methods`: [Documentation](https://docs.spreedly.com/reference/api/v1/#list) - `certificates`: [Documentation](https://docs.spreedly.com/reference/api/v1/#list-certificates) - `transactions`: [Documentation](https://docs.spreedly.com/reference/api/v1/#list49) - `environments`: [Documentation](https://docs.spreedly.com/reference/api/v1/#list-environments)

This notebook covers how to load documents from an `Obsidian` database.  Since `Obsidian` is just stored on disk as a folder of Markdown files, the loader just takes a path to this directory.  `Obsidian` files also sometimes contain [metadata](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Metadata) which is a YAML block at the top of the file. These values will be added to the document's metadata. (`ObsidianLoader` can also be passed a `collect_metadata=False` argument to disable this behavior.)

Datasets are mainly used to save results of [Apify Actors](https://apify.com/store)—serverless cloud programs for varius web scraping, crawling, and data extraction use cases.  This notebook shows how to load Apify datasets to LangChain.   ## Prerequisites  You need to have an existing dataset on the Apify platform. If you don't have one, please first check out [this notebook](../../../agents/tools/examples/apify.ipynb) on how to use Apify to extract content from documentation, knowledge bases, help centers, or blogs.

Here is some code:
from langchain.document_loaders import ApifyDatasetLoader
from langchain.document_loaders.base import Document

Then provide a function that maps Apify dataset record fields to LangChain `Document` format.  For example, if your dataset items are structured like this:  ```json {     ""url"": ""https://apify.com"",     ""text"": ""Apify is the best web scraping and automation platform."" } ```  The mapping function in the code below will convert them to LangChain `Document` format, so that you can use them further with any LLM model (e.g. for question answering).

811,811,"## Extracting metadata  Generally, we want to include metadata available in the JSON file into the documents that we create from the content.  The following demonstrates how metadata can be extracted using the `JSONLoader`.  There are some key changes to be noted. In the previous example where we didn't collect the metadata, we managed to directly specify in the schema where the value for the `page_content` can be extracted from.  ``` .messages[].content ```  In the current example, we have to tell the loader to iterate over the records in the `messages` field. The jq_schema then has to be:  ``` .messages[] ```  This allows us to pass the records (dict) into the `metadata_func` that has to be implemented. The `metadata_func` is responsible for identifying which pieces of information in the record should be included in the metadata stored in the final `Document` object.  Additionally, we now have to explicitly specify in the loader, via the `content_key` argument, the key from the record where the value for the `page_content` needs to be extracted from. 
Here is some code:
# Define the metadata extraction function.
def metadata_func(record: dict, metadata: dict) -> dict:

    metadata[""sender_name""] = record.get(""sender_name"")

However, it is possible that the JSON data contain these keys as well. The user can then exploit the `metadata_func` to rename the default keys and use the ones from the JSON data.

This notebook covers how to load documents from `OneDrive`. Currently, only docx, doc, and pdf files are supported.  ## Prerequisites 1. Register an application with the [Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) instructions. 2. When registration finishes, the Azure portal displays the app registration's Overview pane. You see the Application (client) ID. Also called the `client ID`, this value uniquely identifies your application in the Microsoft identity platform. 3. During the steps you will be following at **item 1**, you can set the redirect URI as `http://localhost:8000/callback` 4. During the steps you will be following at **item 1**, generate a new password (`client_secret`) under Application Secrets section. 5. Follow the instructions at this [document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis#add-a-scope) to add the following `SCOPES` (`offline_access` and `Files.Read.All`) to your application. 6. Visit the [Graph Explorer Playground](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer) to obtain your `OneDrive ID`. The first step is to ensure you are logged in with the account associated your OneDrive account. Then you need to make a request to `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive` and the response will return a payload with a field `id` that holds the ID of your OneDrive account. 7. You need to install the o365 package using the command `pip install o365`. 8. At the end of the steps you must have the following values:  - `CLIENT_ID` - `CLIENT_SECRET` - `DRIVE_ID`  ## 🧑 Instructions for ingesting your documents from OneDrive  ### 🔑 Authentication  By default, the `OneDriveLoader` expects that the values of `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` must be stored as environment variables named `O365_CLIENT_ID` and `O365_CLIENT_SECRET` respectively. You could pass those environment variables through a `.env` file at the root of your application or using the following command in your script.  ```python os.environ['O365_CLIENT_ID'] = ""YOUR CLIENT ID"" os.environ['O365_CLIENT_SECRET'] = ""YOUR CLIENT SECRET"" ```  This loader uses an authentication called [*on behalf of a user*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-v2-user?context=graph%2Fapi%2F1.0&view=graph-rest-1.0). It is a 2 step authentication with user consent. When you instantiate the loader, it will call will print a url that the user must visit to give consent to the app on the required permissions. The user must then visit this url and give consent to the application. Then the user must copy the resulting page url and paste it back on the console. The method will then return True if the login attempt was succesful.   ```python from langchain.document_loaders.onedrive import OneDriveLoader  loader = OneDriveLoader(drive_id=""YOUR DRIVE ID"") ```  Once the authentication has been done, the loader will store a token (`o365_token.txt`) at `~/.credentials/` folder. This token could be used later to authenticate without the copy/paste steps explained earlier. To use this token for authentication, you need to change the `auth_with_token` parameter to True in the instantiation of the loader.  ```python from langchain.document_loaders.onedrive import OneDriveLoader  loader = OneDriveLoader(drive_id=""YOUR DRIVE ID"", auth_with_token=True) ```  ### 🗂️ Documents loader  #### 📑 Loading documents from a OneDrive Directory  `OneDriveLoader` can load documents from a specific folder within your OneDrive. For instance, you want to load all documents that are stored at `Documents/clients` folder within your OneDrive.   ```python from langchain.document_loaders.onedrive import OneDriveLoader  loader = OneDriveLoader(drive_id=""YOUR DRIVE ID"", folder_path=""Documents/clients"", auth_with_token=True) documents = loader.load() ```  #### 📑 Loading documents from a list of Documents IDs  Another possibility is to provide a list of `object_id` for each document you want to load. For that, you will need to query the [Microsoft Graph API](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer) to find all the documents ID that you are interested in. This [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/onedrive?view=graph-rest-1.0#commonly-accessed-resources) provides a list of endpoints that will be helpful to retrieve the documents ID.  For instance, to retrieve information about all objects that are stored at the root of the Documents folder, you need make a request to: `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/drives/{YOUR DRIVE ID}/root/children`. Once you have the list of IDs that you are interested in, then you can instantiate the loader with the following parameters.   ```python from langchain.document_loaders.onedrive import OneDriveLoader  loader = OneDriveLoader(drive_id=""YOUR DRIVE ID"", object_ids=[""ID_1"", ""ID_2""], auth_with_token=True) documents = loader.load() ```

Use it to search in a specific language part of Wikipedia - optional `load_max_docs`: default=100. Use it to limit number of downloaded documents. It takes time to download all 100 documents, so use a small number for experiments. There is a hard limit of 300 for now. - optional `load_all_available_meta`: default=False.
